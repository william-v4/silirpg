# silirpg
a CS30 project

still very scuffed. but it works..., kinda

## web version: 
here's the web version: https://william-v4.github.io/silirpg/
### some issues
- the resource file is like 120MB, so it might not work on slow connections and pls don't play on data
- to pause, hit esc twice because it conflicts with the browser
- to return to the game, right click
- if for some reason your cursor is not captured when expected (3D), you're frozen, or right click doesn't work, just try different combinations of esc and right click until it works. Unfortunately stuff like this behaves real funky in a browser
- this game doesn't work properly in Firefox for some reason because it messes up mouse sensitivity :(
